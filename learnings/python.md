**MIT lectures, what have I learned/need to practice:**

- Pythonic for loops with elements directly

- Specification for functions (at the start comment what it does, and what inputs/outputs has)

- Function scopes/frame/enviorements, global scope vs f scope

- Tuples [Inmutable] vs List [mutable] (alisaing and clonning problems too)

- Recursion functions ( f(x)= something & f(x-1) )

- Dictionaries (play with them, understand them)

- Unit testing (functions) -> Regression testing (if you changed something, check again) -> Integration testing (hole system)

- Black box testing (with specification only, it can be math boundries, irrationals, decimals, extremes, etc...) & glass box testing (with code, go through all paths of the code, through code boundaries also)

- Debugg with [try: , except: , assertions &  with prints/raises/returns, etc..]
