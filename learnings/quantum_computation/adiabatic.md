## **Adiabatic stuff:**
- Adiabatically moving from H0 to H1, makes the ground state move (if time is slow enough compared with the gap)
- Transitions from states if < phi | d phi > != 0, there is mixing! (if enough adiabatically this goes to 0)
- Instantaneous eigenstates != real solution of schrodinger eq.
- Ansatz with coefficient in front of the instantaneous eigenstates, have both time (common) and geometric phase (Berry phase)
- Berry phase for a closed path is gauge invariant, so it is and observable, and has a connection associated, which has a flux, that give a curvature, etc!
- The geometrical phase is given by the solid angle traced by the loop in bloch sphere
- The berry connection appears in the effective nuclear hamiltonians, as the effect of the electronic wave functions on the nucleus!
