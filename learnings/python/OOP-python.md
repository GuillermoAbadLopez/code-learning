**OOP:**
* Contructors: --init-- creates the class with initial attributes
* Methods: are functions/operations within the class
* Instances: are usages of the class
* Use getters and setters for accessing/changing an object, so you don't modify it into not allowed types
* No standard way to get the name of the object
* Default values in attributes makes that you don't need to write them when creating the instance
* Subclasses have as types their upperclass, and they inherit all the attributes and methods of it
* Class variables vs instance vairables (each instance can increment class counter for example)
* Decorators (wrapper, wrapps the function under it [the function under it defines functions inside the wrapper which is the main thing]) {play more with them}
* Classmethods/instancemethods/staticmethods understand/use them
